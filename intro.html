                My goal in life is to be as well rounded as possible. <br><br>

                To pursue this from an interpersonal perspective, I try to know a little about a lot, so that I can know
                just enough to engage with anyone about their favorite subject. I try to listen to a wide variety of
                music, learn as much as possible about anything I come across, and I’ve even started learning how to
                read Russian, Japanese, Arabic, and Korean to be able to connect with as many people as
                possible.<br><br>
                My well-roundedness extends to my personal life, too. At Georgia Tech, I’m surrounded by all kinds of
                people that are outstanding in their fields. Even among just my closest friends at Tech, there’s a
                computer scientist, mathematician, biologist, and passionate engineers in a wide array of
                fields–aerospace, electrical, mechanical, biomedical. All of these people are outstanding and inspiring
                in their fields (as you would expect from Georgia Tech students), but I have found that many of them
                aren’t quite as exceptional outside the scope of their disciplines. They’re limited when it comes to
                communication, collaboration, and design.<br><br>
                In order to avoid exhibiting the same shortcomings as my peers, I have made it my professional goal to
                be as broadly capable and hirable as possible. After all, it doesn’t matter if someone is the best
                computer engineer of all time if they can’t communicate their ideas effectively.<br><br>
                This website is proof of my desire to be as capable as possible. I’m sure you’ve already noticed, but
                this website wasn’t made by copying text into a template in a UI designed to be as accessible as
                possible. While website creation tools are great for most people, I took this as an opportunity to
                creatively stretch myself and (try to) learn html and css to design my own website. As a computer
                engineer, html and css, which are primarily front end development tools, aren’t the most important skill
                for me to have. And while this website probably doesn’t look or feel as good as it could if I had used a
                template, I hope it serves to demonstrate my desire to constantly better myself and engage in creative
                challenges.<br><br>
