                Growing up, I was never challenged by school. As similar situations did for many people before me, this
                resulted in me having no idea how to study.<br><br>

                Over the past four months, I’ve been doing my best to teach myself how to learn.<br><br>

                I’ve started scheduling out time to study, using a Pomodoro timer, and putting my phone away when I’m
                working.<br><br>

                I’ve definitely started studying more efficiently, but I’m still not where I want to be
                academically.<br><br>

                The way I see it, if I can get really good at studying, the benefits will be twofold. First, the obvious
                one: I’ll get better grades. Secondly, though, this would free up so much free time that I can use to
                better myself. If I am able to get my act together, I want to use my free time to get better at
                programming, teach myself about computer hardware, and put energy into projects that I’m proud of.

                My biggest inspiration growing up was my uncle, Brian Hook.


                He has worked on the Quake engine, the Oculus VR headsets, and was the director of a team of engineers
                at Facebook for a number of years. <br><br>

                His level of talent has afforded him some handsome salaries and benefits, a portion of which has
                trickled down to me in the form of Christmas gifts. <br><br>

                The Christmas and birthday gifts I received from him reshaped the course of my childhood–he allowed me
                to explore a wonderful variety of passions that may have otherwise been prohibitively expensive.
                <br><br>

                Importantly, though, his jobs had been fun. He’s not a lawyer or an accountant (which I imagine would be
                very boring); he got to play with gadgets and gizmos and make games. <br><br>

                That’s what I want. I not only get to be professionally fulfilled, but I will be able to fund and
                facilitate not only my own passions, but also those of my loved ones. <br><br>

                To pursue this, I’m starting with internships over the course of the next four years. I’m currently an
                intern at a tech startup called Tenovos. In the past, I have done documentation writing for them, but
                I’m starting as a software engineering intern next semester. <br><br>

                Beyond this current internship, I want to branch out into a variety of internships before I graduate so
                I can get familiar with a range of work environments, learn skills, find what I really love to do, and
                bolster my resume. <br><br>

                Even longer term, my absolute dream is to research computer architecture and develop cutting edge
                computing technology. Alternatively, I would also love to develop hardware for a company like Apple or
                Google.

                In order to be successful in the tech industry, I need to better myself now. I hope to graduate from Georgia Tech in Spring 2027, so before then I want to get a variety of
                internships during my college experience, learn how to work more efficiently, and pursue extraneous
                skills that make me more capable and hireable. I expect to work various jobs in tech as I gain skills
                and become exceptional in my field.
