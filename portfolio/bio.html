                I’m Cooper Shaw, a first year Computer Engineering major at Georgia Tech.<br><br>
                I hate to admit it, but I’m only one small coincidence away from not being able to say that.<br><br>
                Not many first year Georgia Tech students have the unfortunate privilege of saying this, but I was
                rejected from Georgia Tech. <br><br>
                On Thursday, May 25th, 2023, I received an email from Georgia Tech admissions saying, “At this point,
                our incoming first-year class is full and we are not able to offer you admission.”<br><br>
                On Friday, May 26th, 2023, the day after I was rejected from the waitlist, I received a second email
                saying, “Congratulations! We are happy to offer you admission to Georgia Tech's 2023 first-year class
                for the Fall term beginning on Monday, August 21, 2023.”<br><br>
                How did I reverse this decision in the span of just a day? By getting absurdly lucky.<br><br>
                Georgia Tech offers guaranteed admission to Valedictorian and Salutatorians of all public Georgia high
                schools. By the thinnest of margins, I was Salutatorian of Marietta High school.<br><br>

                <img src="images/gradspeech.jpg" class="imgright">

                When I say “the thinnest of margins,” I mean it. My GPA was 0.01 points higher than 3rd place, and 0.02
                higher than 4th. I couldn’t have cut it closer.<br><br>
                And this wasn’t by design. I didn’t mean to be Salutatorian. Granted, in freshman year, I could be
                quoted as saying “I might be Valedictorian or Salutatorian,” but this wasn’t a vow that I strove to
                achieve. Instead, it was just an observation of my dedication to school for dedication’s sake; I really
                didn’t care whether I was top-ranked–I did it because that's just who I am.<br><br>
                What’s even more absurd is the fact that I was forced into taking eight 5.0-level classes Senior year. I
                just happened to have a weird set of courses that would have left me with free blocks in the middle of
                the day,
                If I had taken different classes, I wouldn’t have been Salutatorian, and I would be enrolled at UGA
                right now. The entire course of my life would have been different.<br><br>
                While my enrollment at Georgia Tech is due to a series of unlikely events, there’s an important thing to
                remember–I was only in position for those coincidences to occur because of the hard work I was already
                doing. I put myself in a position to be successful.<br><br>
                While I didn’t know my approach to life could be so beneficial at the time, I definitely know it now. I
                understand that hard work can pay off, and you’re much more likely to get lucky if you set yourself up
                for success.<br><br>
                Right now, I’m setting myself up for success by working hard in college, focusing on my internship at
                Tenovos, and
                independently learning outside of what is required of me.
